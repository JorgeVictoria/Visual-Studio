    <div class="borde">Hello world!!</div>

    <p>The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a 
        new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to 
        the left and right as far as it can).</p>

    <p>This is an inline span <span class="borde">Hello World!!</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

    <p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much 
        width as necessary.</p>
